# .Xresources-theme

This theme reads it's colors from your `~/.Xresources` file, so that you can
easily keep your emacs theme in sync with your xterm and other X applications.

## In Action

Here you can see xterm and emacs, both configured with
[the .Xresources version of solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized/blob/master/xresources/solarized).
